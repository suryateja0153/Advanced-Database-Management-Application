## Design & Progamming
{: style="text-align: justify" }
This project goes over database management and applications of optimization techniques enhancing querying performance from databases like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server etc.
- Doc-1: Includes advanced SQL querying such as nested querying, joining multiple tables, sub querying etc.
- Doc-2: Includes database design (ERD), normalization, data redundancy, setting keys etc.
- Doc-3: Includes techniques for efficient search like selectivity, indexing, function based indexing, database programming etc.
- Doc-4: Includes querying performance enhancing techniques like optimizer modes, transaction processing, parallel processing, partitioning etc.

## Conclusion
{: style="text-align: justify" }
This was an interesting project which helped me understand the complexity of database management and enabled me to learn various optimization techniques that help with efficient querying like indexing, transaction processing, parallel processing, partitioning etc. while also allowing me to brush up on my SQL programming skills where I used techniqes like nested querying, subquerying, database programming etc. to solve business problems.
